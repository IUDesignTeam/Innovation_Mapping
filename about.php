      		<h4>About</h4>
      		<p class = "overview">As an organization, UNICEF has been innovating for decades. Over the past
	 		few months, we invited country offices to input their innovative activities
 			in to the mapping and see their initiatives along with others in
 			realtime. Based on their input, we could identify trends, commonalities,
 			gaps and difficulties, and highlight successes.</p>

 			<p class = "overview"> We are dedicated to improve the map, and make it more useful for our
 			colleagues around the world, external partners as well as anyone who might
 			be interested. In the second iteration of the map, some of the added
 			features and changes are as follows:</p><br>
 			<ul>
    			<li>User logins that allow updates and edits to your submitted projects</li>
    			<li>Search and filter ability</li>
    			<li>Updated questionnaire</li>
    			<li>Allowing for embedded multimedia content</li>
    			<li>Improved visuals.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
 			<p class = "overview">We continue to welcome your input into the map and check out other
 			innovation initiatives. Please note that each UNICEF country office and
 			regional office is provided with one login, which is required to submit and
 			edit projects.</p>
 			If you have any question, please feel free to contact the Innovation
 			Unit.</p>
