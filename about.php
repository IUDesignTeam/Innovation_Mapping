      		<h4>About</h4>
      		<p class="overview">As an organization, UNICEF has been innovating for decades. Over the past 
      		few months, we invited country offices to input their innovative activities 
      		into the mapping and to see their project alongside other initiatives in 
      		realtime. The aggregated information allows us to identify trends, commonalities, 
      		gaps and difficulties, as well as highlight successes.</p>

 			<p class = "overview"> We are dedicated to improving the map in order to make it more useful for our
 			colleagues around the world, external partners as well as anyone who might
 			be interested. In this version of the map, some of the added
 			features and changes are as follows:</p><br>
 			<ul>
    			<li>User logins that allow updates and edits to your submitted projects</li>
    			<li>Search and filter ability</li>
    			<li>Updated questionnaire</li>
    			<li>Allowing for embedded multimedia content</li>
    			<li>Improved visuals.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
 			<p>We continue to welcome your input and feedback.</p>
 			<p> Please note that each UNICEF country office and
 			regional office is provided with one login, which is required to submit and
 			edit projects.</p>
 			<p>If you have any question, please feel free to contact the NYHQ Innovation
 			Unit at zma@unicef.org</p>
