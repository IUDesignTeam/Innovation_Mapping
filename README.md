Global Mapping of UNICEF Innovations
==================
As an organization, UNICEF has been innovating for decades. Over the past few months, we invited country offices to input their innovative activities into the mapping and to see their project alongside other initiatives in realtime. The aggregated information allows us to identify trends, commonalities, gaps and difficulties, as well as highlight successes.

We are dedicated to improving the map in order to make it more useful for our colleagues around the world, external partners as well as anyone who might be interested. In this version of the map, some of the added features and changes are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>User logins that allow updates and edits to your submitted projects</li>
  <li>Search and filter ability</li>
  <li>Updated questionnaire</li>
  <li>Improved visuals</li>
</ul>
